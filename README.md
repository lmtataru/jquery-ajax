We have the following endpoint: http://api.icndb.com/jokes/random

He returns a joke to us randomly every time we make the call.

The structure of this is like the following JSON (we are interested in the "joke" field):

  {
  
    "type": "success",
    
    "value": {
     
        "id": 19,
        
        "joke": "In an average living room there are 1,242 objects Chuck Norris could use to kill you, including the room itself.",
        
        "categories": []
        
      }
      
  }
  
Create a web page with a space to put the joke and a button that, using an AJAX call, shows a new joke every time we click on the button.
